# **Kemet**

### A learning project made using CSS3, HTML5, and Vanilla JavaScript to create a web page that provide information about Egyptian hertaige and Language .

#### I used this project to apply some basic knowledge of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** is used to build the components of the web page in a separate file using different HTML tags, and used nesting for styling purposes.

- **CSS3** is used to style the web page using:
  - var() to use variables in root for easier change of the repeated values e.g. colors, dimensions.
  - flex & grid for layouts.
  - keyframes, transition, and transform for Animations.
  - media queries for responsive design.
  - Pseudo-elements to adjust some elements borders.
  - Pseudo-classes to change style elements on Hover.

- **JavaScript** is used to give some responses to user actions using:
  - document functions e.g.: querySelector, querySelectorAll.
  - window functions e.g.: innerHeight, innerHeight.
  - eventListeners.
  - array functions e.g.: map, filter.
  - customized function e.g. arrow functions, anonymous functions.
  - regular expressions to extract values of HTML attribute Also getAttribute.
  - if statements for conditions.
  - for loops.
