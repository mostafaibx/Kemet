### A learning project made using CSS3, HTML5, and Vanilla JavaScript.

####I used this project to apply some basic knowledge of JavaScript, CSS and HTML

- HTML is used to build the components of the web page in a separate file using diffrent HTML tags, and used nesting for styling purposes.
  
- CSS3 is used to style the web page using:
 - var() to use variable in root for easier change of the repeated values e.g. colors, diminsions.
 - flex & grid for layouts.
 - keyframes, transation and transform for Animations).
 - mediaquery for responsive design.
 - Psudo elements to adjust some elements borders.
 - Psudo classes to change style elements on Hover.

- JS is used to give some responses to user actions using:
 - document functions e.g.: querySelector, querySelectorAll.
 - window functions e.g.: innerHeight, innerHeight.
 - eventListeners.
 - array functions e.g.: map, filter.
 - customized function e.g. arrow functions, anonymous functions.
 - regular expression to extract values of HTML attribute Also getAttribute.
 - if statments for conditions.
